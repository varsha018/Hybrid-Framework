	update below:
	               Upgrade dependency extentreports-cucumber6-adapter to version 2.8.2 s
	               
	               
Cucumber can be executed in parallel using JUNIT and MAVEN test execution plugin


In JUnit the feature files are run in parallel rather than scenarios,
which means all the scenarios in feature file will be executed by the same thread.

We can use Maven Surefire or failsafe plugin to execute the runners
